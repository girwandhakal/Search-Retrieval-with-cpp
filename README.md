# Serarch and Retrieval with C++

This project is a C++ program that reads movie data from a database file and allows users to query for a list of movies or actors. The program parses the input files, maps movie titles to their corresponding actors and vice versa, and provides an interface to search for movies by title or find all movies an actor has appeared in.

## Features

- Reads movie and actor data from a database file.
- Maps movie titles to their respective actors and actors to their movies using hash maps for efficient lookup.
- Provides functionality to:
  - Query the list of actors in a given movie.
  - Query the list of movies an actor has appeared in.
- Displays "Not found" if the query does not match any movie or actor in the database.
